The itsy bitsy spider went up the water spout
Down came the rain and washed the spider out
Out came the sun and dried up all the rain
Then the itsy bitsy spider went up the spout again

Okay…put your fingers together
Let’s do The Itsy Bitsy Spider

The itsy bitsy spider went up the water spout
Down came the rain and washed the spider out
Out came the sun and dried up all the rain
Then the itsy bitsy spider went up the spout again

A little faster now

The itsy bitsy spider went up the water spout
Down came the rain and washed the spider out
Out came the sun and dried up all the rain
Then the itsy bitsy spider went up the spout again

Now let’s try it slow, with a low voice
And a big, big spider

The big, big spider went up the water spout
Down came the rain and washed the spider out
Out came the sun and dried up all the rain
Then the big, big spider went up the spout again
