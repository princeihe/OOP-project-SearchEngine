Love is like a circus
And a carnival is beautiful to see
Love can turn your mind around
Like Ferris wheels and spinning carousels
You'll be a part of the world of make believe
Flying high like a man on a trapeze
Oh everyday's a holiday
Get your tickets right away
Love love love
Is the greatest show on Earth
The fantasy you see is like
A child again through rainbow-colored eyes
Step right up it's circus time
And get your money's worth of love today
You'll be a part of the world of make believe
Flying high like a man on a trapeze
Everyday's a holiday
Get your tickets right away
Love love yeah
Is the greatest show on Earth
Everyday's a holiday
Get your tickets right away
Love love love
Is the greatest show on Earth
Love love love
Is the greatest show on earth (Yeah yeah)
Love love yeah
Is the greatest show on earth
Love love yeah
